    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The original recipe for mint chicken appears in the 13th-century Syrian cookbook al-Wusla ila l-habib. Arabic cookbooks from this period offer recipes for chicken with mint, caraway, and garlic, which reflects the highly aromatic and perfumed banquets of Syria</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</p>
